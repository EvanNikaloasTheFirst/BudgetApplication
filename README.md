Here I have created an application where users can add expenses and incoming into the application and then the application will calculate the inputs and displays the total cash flow , the amount of the total expenses and wether the user is in arreas.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Simply enter the amount you desire in the first input box and click the button placed to the right to enter the amount.

To insert the expense: type in the name of the expense in the second inputbox followed by the amount in the last input box.

Then proceed to click the button placed to the right.

I was working with object, their properties, extracting input values and being able to combine values to produce an output.
